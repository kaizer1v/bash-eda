# EDA using BASH commands

This notebook explores ways to do basic data analysis on files using shell commands. This requires you to know some basic bash scripting and shell commands. It also assumes that you are aware of basic data analysis methods. This project is inspired by [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - python based data analysis library, a very popular one.

For the purpose of this notebook, we are going to be using the `flags.csv` data available in this repo.

# Reading Files

**Display columns**

```bash
head -1 flags.csv
```

If the delimiter is different than a space and want to print every column in a new line, pipe the `sed` command like

```bash
# assuming that the delimiter is a `:` char
head -1 flags.csv | sed -e s/:/\\n/g
```

Similarly, if you want to know the number of columns

```bash
# assuming that the delimiter is a `:` char
head -1 flags.csv | sed -e s/:/\\n/g | wc -l
```


**Display top `n` columns**

```bash
head -n10 flags.csv
```

**Display bottom `n` columns**

```bash
tail -n10 flags.csv
```

**Display number of lines**

```bash
wc -l flags.csv
```

**Display total word counts**

```bash
wc flags.csv
```

**Display head of specific columns**

```bash
# displays head of column 10 and 11
awk -F: '{print $10 $11 }' flags.csv | head -5
```

**Get index of a column by it's name**
Let's say you want to know the index of the column `Continent`, you would do

```bash
# assuming that your delimeter is the `:` char
head -1 flags.csv | sed -e s/:/\\n/g | grep -n Continent | cut -c1-2 
```

if the column name does not exist, then it will not return anything.

**You can sort a file like**

```bash
# -r is for reverse/descending order
sort -r flags.csv
```

You can even sort based on a specific column. So, let's extract only specific columns first by

```bash
# will columns 1st, 10th and 11th column
# ID, Name, Continent
cut -d: -f1,10,11 flags.csv
```

now, let's take that and sort it by the 2nd column i.e. the Name - which is the country name by descending order

```bash
#                               -k is for column #, -r is for reverse
cut -d: -f1,10,11 flags.csv | sort -k2 -r
```


**View specific columns**

Say you only want to view the `ID`, `Name` and the `Continent` column, first you need to know the ids of the columns - 

```bash
head -1 flags.csv | sed s/:/\\n/g
```

will display the columns vertically and then you can get the index of the columns (manually for now) to retrieve the column numbers. Note that the column index/numbers start from 1 and not from 0. Now, after you have retrieved the column numbers, you can choose the specific columns to view like

```bash
cut -d: -f1,10,11 flags.csv | head
```

**Filtering**

view only **Europe** continent's countries and IDs

```bash
cut -d: -f1,10,11 flags.csv | grep Europe
```

and if you want to see the number of countries within Europe, you can

```bash
cut -d: -f1,10,11 flags.csv | grep Europe | wc -l
```

**NOT** 

Similarly, if you want to view all the Continent's other than Europe, then simply add the `-v` option in the grep

```bash
cut -d: -f1,10,11 flags.csv | grep -cv Europe
```

the `-c` in the `grep` command will only return the `count` by defult instead of adding `wc -l` at the end of the line.

**You can view unique values of a column like**

For example, you want to view all distinct values of the `Continents` column

```bash
# 10th column points to the Continent column
awk -F: '{print $10}' flags.csv | sort -u
```

**To count the unique rows**

```bash
# counts the distinct count of `Name` column
awk -F: '{print $11}' flags.csv | sort -u | wc -l
```

**value counts**

get the value counts for a the `Continent` column, do the following

```bash
# Continent is the 11th column
awk -F: '{print $11}' flags.csv | sort | uniq -c
```

an even improved way of doing it is by using `cut` like

```bash
cut -f11 -d: flags.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1,1nr
```

will sort the value counts in descending order for the `Continent` column i.e. column 11


## Merging

For this purposes, consider two files containing the following texts

*file1.txt*

```
Nawazuddin grapes 27
Sardar wasseypur 4
Piyush dhanbad 8
Brad fury 2
DiNero casino 5
Duvall godfather 12
Medson purple 30
Flintstone dude 7
```

and *file2.txt* containing

```
Nawazuddin <pink>
Sardar <blue>
Piyush <orange>
Brad <blue>
DiNero <red>
Duvall <purple>
Medson <blue>
Flintstone <orange>
```

You can merge two files like 

```bash
# delimeter as a space
join file1.txt file2.txt
```

will give you the output **merged** !! 

```
Nawazuddin <pink> grapes 27
Sardar <blue> wasseypur 4
Piyush <orange> dhanbad 8
Brad <blue> fury 2
DiNero <red> casino 5
Duvall <purple> godfather 12
Medson <blue> purple 30
Flintstone <orange> dude 7
```

**Preview a large file**

```bash
less large_file.csv
```

will help you load only the section of the file and then load the remaining as you navigate - saves memory usage for really large files - without reading the full file.

Now, if you want to view only the rows containing a particular pattern and view it partly

```bash
strings large_file.csv | grep some_string | less 
```

Similary,
**view the count occurances of `some_string`**

```bash
strings large_file.csv | grep some_string | wc -l
```


## Numeric Values

For this section prepare with a sample file which you download by running the following command

```bash
wget https://www.data36.com/demo1.csv --no-check-certificate
```

will save a file called `demo1.csv`

**Sort numeric values**

by running the `sort demo1.csv` will sort the values assuming that it contains text values, but you will need to add the `-n` parameter to make it sort like numbers

```bash
# the `u` will only return unique values
sort -nu demo1.csv
```

So if you had to get the max, min values you would

```bash
# min
sort -nu demo1.csv | head -1
# max
sort -nu demo1.csv | tail -1
```
